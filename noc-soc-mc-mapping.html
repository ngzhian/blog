        <p><em>NOC is a big deal, so you&#39;ll probably have questions. This hopefully-series of articles serves to tell you more about a SOC student going on NOC in New York. Hope this helps you, feel free to drop me suggestions/questions at ngzhian@nus.edu.sg</em></p>
<p>In one year, you should be able to clear 40 MCs in order to be MC-neutral<sup>*</sup>.
For my batch we are able to clear up to <strong>32 MCs</strong> because we do not have discipline-based module<sup>#</sup></p>
<p>Here&#39;s how I allocated my MCs (Computer Science):</p>
<p>| Module Code |  Name | MCs | Map to |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------|---|
|    TR3101    |    Internship Continuous assessment    |    4     |    Internship |
|    TR3102    |    Internship Program Report            |    8    |    Internship |
|    TR3103    |    Start up Business case                |    8    |    ULR |
|    TR3002    |    New Venture Creation                |    4     |    UEM |
|    MG2304    |    Marketing                            |    4     |    UEM |
|    TRXXXX    |    TBC<sup>?</sup>                        |    4     |    UEM |</p>
<p>For <strong>CS</strong> students, <code>TR3101</code> and <code>TR3102</code> can go towards clearing our <a href='http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/cs_cs_2012_13.html'>program requirements</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Either<br />
CP4101 BComp Dissertation<br />
or<br />
Complete 12 MCs by taking CS modules at level-4000 or above, or modules approved by the Department of Computer Science<br />
or<br />
12 MCs of Industrial Experience Training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For <strong>IS/EC</strong> students, they can map IS4010 Industry Internship Programme (equivalent to 12-MC FYP or 3 IS modules) to NOC (TR3101 and TR3102). The other TR module confirmed is TR2202 Technological Innovation. (Thanks Jason for this!)</p>
<p>Check the requirements for your cohort to be sure.</p>
<p>Recall that the breakdown of ULR is</p>
<ul><li>8 MCs on GEM</li><li>4 MCs on SS</li><li>8 MCs on Breadth</li></ul>

<p>so <code>TR3103</code> essentially completes my ULR requirement.</p>
<p>The remaining 3 modules (<code>TR3002</code>, <code>MG2304</code>, <code>TRXXXX</code>) maps to my UE, which has a cap of 20 MCs. This means that for you to be MC neutral, you should not have taken more than 2 UEs thus far.</p>
<h2 id="Whataboutthe8MCsleft">What about the 8 MCs left?</h2><p><code>40 - 32 = 8MCs</code>, so at the end of NOC I would have 8 MCs I need to clear.</p>
<p>In my case, I haven&#39;t taken a single UE yet, so this 8 MCs will be used on UEs. I took Orbtial (a summer module) in Year 1, so that clears 4 MCs. I plan to overload 1 module in my final year, so that I can make 160 MCs and graduate in 4 years.</p>
<h2 id="Needmoreinfo">Need more info?</h2><p>Shoot me a question ngzhian@nus.edu.sg</p>
<p><sup>*</sup> this means to not take more modules than necessary</p>
<p><sup>#</sup> reasons are not easy to explain, and this might change for your batch</p>
<p><sup>?</sup> module not confirmed but can definitely map it to UE</p>
