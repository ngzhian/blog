<p>From Oct 2015 to Aug 2016, I had the good fortune of interning at 3 respectable companies: Google, Stripe, and Uber.</p>
<p>In this post I wish to share my experiences at the 3 different places.</p>

<h2 id="interview-process">Interview process</h2>
<p>The interview processes at the 3 companies were pretty similar, with a initial HR phone call, followed by multiple technical screens. Of special note is Stripe’s, who flew me from Singapore to San Francisco for an on-site interview.</p>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>Initial HR phone call with recruiter, followed by 3 back-to-back technical interviews via phone and Google Docs on the same day. After I passed the technical interviews, there are N phone calls with teams that are interested to pick up an intern. For me, N = 1, but it can vary.</p>
<h3 id="stripe">Stripe</h3>
<p>Initial HR phone call with recruiter, technical interview via Skype and shared screen coding, on site with 3 or 4 (can’t remember) technical interviews and a lunch with an engineering manager. More details on the on site can be found in this <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-engineering-interview-process-like-at-Stripe">Quora post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="uber">Uber</h3>
<p>Initial HR phone call with recruiter, followed by 2 technical phone calls with online collaborative IDE, and 1 phone call with a manager.</p>
<h2 id="team-i-was-in-projects-i-worked-on">Team I was in, projects I worked on</h2>
<p>Details will be scarce in this section due to confidentiality, but I try to give a higher level look as to the kind of work interns got at each company.</p>
<h3 id="google-1">Google</h3>
<p>Internal tool to convert a service written in old framework style into a service written in the new framework style. This was a internship task that my mentor scoped out for me. I finished this ahead of time, so I went on to another task related to a bot that comments on the internal bug tracker when certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>My project was clearly scoped out to be an intern project: it wasn’t anything critical, but was something that an Intern could do and would be helpful to the team. Throughout my internship, I was not involved in the projects that my colleagues were doing.</p>
<h3 id="stripe-1">Stripe</h3>
<p>I was initially given smaller tasks that were on the sprints to get warmed up, so I dealt a little with merchant search (that’s the search feature you see if you are a logged into your Stripe dashboard), and also a little with API permission. I had 2 big tasks scoped out by my mentor, the first had to do with the frontend of a new <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Connect</a> feature, the second has to do with creating a new data pipeline to calculate fees.</p>
<p>The features that I was tasked with are additions to the core product, especially the data pipeline with actually affects the company’s earnings! I felt like the entire team trusts me. My team ran a 2 week sprint system, with weekly sprint meetings, and I was encouraged to participate like a full timer.</p>
<h3 id="uber-1">Uber</h3>
<p>The first task was to run an experiment on web <a href="https://get.uber.com/">sign up form</a> to get warmed up. While this was in progress (experiments take a while to run), I was in discussion with my mentor for subsequent tasks. Eventually we settled extracting a microservice, which was the work the rest of my team was going to be working on for the subsequent months.</p>
<p>My team runs a weekly sprint system, and the bigger team that we’re part of has a 2-week sprint cycle. I mostly worked within my immediate team, knocking tasks of a task board we set up to track our own tasks.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h2>
<h3 id="google-2">Google</h3>
<p>Well known for its giant <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/">monorepo</a>, has extremely well thought out tools for developing, building, testing, etc. Main languages used are C++, Java, Python. A lot of internal tools that are slowly being open sourced, build tool <a href="http://bazel.io">bazel</a>, code search <a href="https://kythe.io/">kythe</a>, etc. Uses internal tool for running servers, open sourced as <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="stripe-2">Stripe</h3>
<p>Main languages are Ruby and Scala. Uses Github for code, PR, code review, phabricator for issue tracking. Deploys to AWS using a custom tool, and developers can develop on AWS instances too.</p>
<h3 id="uber-2">Uber</h3>
<p>I worked mainly on Python, phabricator for code review, has a custom tool to deploy, each dev spawns an AWS instance to develop on. There are 2 blog posts that goes into their stack more in depth, encourage you to read them <a href="https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/">here</a>, and <a href="https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-two/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="day-to-day-life">Day to day life</h2>
<p>Life was really good at all 3 companies, I felt extremely looked after, to the extent of being pampered.</p>
<p>3 meals were provided at every company. At Google and Uber there would be some special pop-up events, hot chocolate, cupcakes, etc. Google has baristas in house, and they make really good lattes with very pretty art.</p>
<p>There is a weekly 1 on 1 with my mentor where we could talk about anything, problems at work, questions about company, issues settling in etc. Stripe has a interesting culture of taking coffee walks, so all my 1 on 1 at Stripe was done while making our way to a coffee shop.</p>
<p>All 3 companies had a weekly all hands meeting as well, where there would be some presentation and a Q&amp;A with heads of the company.</p>
<p>There are tech talks too, and the frequency correlates with the size of the company.</p>
<p>Office hours are really flexible at all companies, they care more about your output than your hours. Time off can be taken as needed with advance notification.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all folks</h2>
<p>I had a really good time at all 3 companies, I felt technically challenged, learned a lot, had very good mentors. If you are interested in applying for an internship and am not sure where to start, check out <a href="https://ymichael.github.io/projectintern/">Project Intern</a>.</p>
