        <h1 id="HowJavasortsObjects">How Java sorts Objects</h1>

<h2 id="Itstartedwithanexperimentonsorting">It started with an experiment on sorting…</h2>

<p>The reason why I had this question in my head was because I was
wondering <a href='../posts/2014-04-28-scissors-paper-stone-and-ordering.html'>how sorting would look like for Scissors, Paper, Stone
objects</a>,
since they have a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order'>cyclic
ordering</a>. And in that
little experiment I used Java’s <code>Collections.sort</code> method, which is
really useful if the class you wish to sort implements
<a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html'><code>Comparable</code></a>,
and that just requires you to define a single method <code>compareTo</code>. So I
went ahead to investigate how Java implements this method. My initial
guess was that for small collections, insertion sort would be used,
because it’s actually more efficient. But for larger collections,
mergesort/quicksort would be used. Eventually I found out I was wrong,
here’s why.</p>
<h2 id="Grepthatmethod">Grep that method</h2>

<p><a href='grepcode.com'>GrepCode</a> is a wonderful resource. It lets you search the
code bases of many open source projects including Java and Eclipse, and
there’s so much to learn from robust code that is being used by so many
people.</p>
<p>A simple search for <code>Collections.sort</code> took me
<a href='http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/java/util/Collections.java#Collections.sort%28java.util.List%29'>here</a>.</p>
<pre><code> {.sourceCode .java}
public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; void  [More ...] sort(List&lt;T&gt; list) {
  Object[] a = list.toArray();
  Arrays.sort(a);
  ListIterator&lt;T&gt; i = list.listIterator();
  for (int j=0; j&lt;a.length; j++) {
    i.next();
    i.set((T)a[j]);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>So actually <code>Collections.sort</code> converts the collection of objects into
an <code>Array</code> internally, and uses <code>Arrays.sort</code>. Sounds like a simple way
to <a href='http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself'>reduce duplication of
code</a>!</p>
<h2 id="DiggingdeeperintosortArrays">Digging deeper into `sort.Arrays</h2>

<p>So I looked into
<a href='http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/java/util/Arrays.java#Arrays.sort%28java.lang.Object%5B%5D%29'><code>Array.sort</code></a>
and see that <code>Arrays.sort</code> uses either <code>legacyMergeSort</code> or something
called <code>ComparableTimSort</code>.</p>
<pre><code> {.sourceCode .java}
public static void  [More ...] sort(Object[] a) {
  if (LegacyMergeSort.userRequested)
    legacyMergeSort(a);
  else
    ComparableTimSort.sort(a);
}</code></pre>

<p>Well I know <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergesort'>mergesort</a>, and it
seems like you need to set some system parameter to use it, so my guess
is that it isn’t used most of the time. How about the other one,
<code>ComparableTimSort</code>?</p>
<h2 id="Timssort">Tim’s sort</h2>

<p>I’ve never heard of such a sort before, so I continued investigating and
reached the <a href='http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/java/util/ComparableTimSort.java#ComparableTimSort.sort%28java.lang.Object%5B%5D%29'>method
definition</a>,
which said this was just like
<a href='http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/java/util/TimSort.java#TimSort'>TimSort</a>.</p>
<p>The comments for the <code>TimSort</code> class actually describes the history of
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort'>TimSort</a>, which was first used
by Python!</p>
<pre><code> {.sourceCode .java}
// A stable, adaptive, iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than n lg(n)
// comparisons when running on partially sorted arrays, while offering
// performance comparable to a traditional mergesort when run on random arrays.
// Like all proper mergesorts, this sort is stable and runs O(n log n) time (worst case).</code></pre>

<p>I haven’t completely figured out how it works, but it has <code>O(n)</code> best
case performance, and performs very well on real world data. Here’s a
<a href='https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt'>description of the
algorithm</a>
by its author Tim Peters, and a <a href='http://sortvis.org/algorithms/timsort.html'>cool
visualization</a> of the
process. Oh by the way that previous website,
<a href='http://sortvis.org'>sortvis</a> has visualizations of other sorting
algorithms as well, check it out!</p>
<h2 id="So">So…</h2>

<p>I don’t really understand Tim’s sort as for now, and I think this won’t
be the last time I’ll see it, but at least know I know how Java sorts
stuff :)</p>
