<p>TODO is the smallest airport in the world, it can only hold 3 planes at
any time. You are the air traffic controller there, and your job is to
plan the landings and taking off of all the planes so that no accidents
happen. This job is not too difficult, you just have to look at the
landing and taking-off sequence, and determine if the airport can
accomodate the sequence. Let’s model that.
<code>haskell  type Planes = Int  type Airport = Planes</code> Planes can land, or
take off:
<code>haskell  land :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Airport  land incoming grounded = grounded + incoming    takeoff :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Airport  takeoff flying grounded = grounded - flying</code>
We can try landing and taking off:
<code>haskell  &gt; takeoff 1 (land 2 0)  1  &gt; takeoff 2 (land 3 (takeoff 1 (land 2 0)))  &gt; 0 `land` 2 `takeoff` 1 `land` 3 `takeoff` 2  2</code>
The second example seems to be okay, but actually we had let 4 planes in
the airport at once. Let’s fix that using <code>Maybe</code>. When we have too many
planes, we return a <code>Nothing</code>, meaning that this particular sequence can
not be accomodated safely by the airport.
<code>haskell  land :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Maybe Airport  land incoming grounded    | grounded + incoming &gt; 3 = Nothing    | otherwise               = Just (grounded + incoming)    takeoff :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Maybe Airport  takeoff flying grounded    | grounded - flying &lt; 0 = Nothing    | otherwise             = Just (grounded - flying)</code>
Let’s try this:
<code>haskell  &gt; land 3 0  Just 3  &gt; land 4 0  Nothing  &gt; takeoff 2 0  Nothing  &gt; takeoff 1 2  Just 1</code>
Now we have a problem because we can no longer chain our <code>land</code> and
<code>takeoff</code> methods together easily. They both return a <code>Maybe Airport</code>,
but they take in <code>Airport</code>. We can try to write a function to take care
of this.
<code>haskell  chain :: Maybe Airport -&gt; (Airport -&gt; Maybe Airport) -&gt; Maybe Airport  chain Nothing _ = Nothing  chain (Just grounded) action = action grounded</code>
And we can now write things smoothly
<code>haskell  &gt; Just 1 `chain` takeoff 1 `chain` land 2 `chain` takeoff 2  Just 0</code>
And if we just change the name of <code>chain</code> to <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>
<code>haskell  &gt; Just 1 -:: takeoff 2  Nothing  &gt; Just 2 -:: takeoff 1  Just 1</code>
There we have it, the <code>bind</code> operator in Monads!</p>
