<p>TODO is the smallest airport in the world, it can only hold 3 planes at
any time.</p>
<p>You are the air traffic controller there, and your job is to
plan the landings and taking off of all the planes so that no accidents
happen.</p>
<p>This job is not too difficult, you just have to look at the
landing and taking-off sequence, and determine if the airport can
accomodate the sequence.</p>
<p>Let’s model that.</p>
<pre class='haskell'><code class='haskell'>type Planes = Int
type Airport = Planes</code></pre>

<p>Planes can land, or take off:</p>
<pre class='haskell'><code class='haskell'>land :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Airport
land incoming grounded = grounded + incoming

takeoff :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Airport
takeoff flying grounded = grounded - flying</code></pre>

<p>We can try landing and taking off:</p>
<pre class='haskell'><code class='haskell'>&gt; takeoff 1 (land 2 0)
1
&gt; takeoff 2 (land 3 (takeoff 1 (land 2 0)))
0
&gt; `land` 2 `takeoff` 1 `land` 3 `takeoff` 2
2</code></pre>

<p>The second example seems to be okay, but actually we had let 4 planes in
the airport at once. Let’s fix that using <code>Maybe</code>.</p>
<p>When we have too many
planes, we return a <code>Nothing</code>, meaning that this particular sequence can
not be accomodated safely by the airport.</p>
<pre class='haskell'><code class='haskell'>land :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Maybe Airport
land incoming grounded
  | grounded + incoming &gt; 3 = Nothing
  | otherwise               = Just (grounded + incoming)

takeoff :: Planes -&gt; Airport -&gt; Maybe Airport
takeoff flying grounded
  | grounded - flying &lt; 0 = Nothing
  | otherwise             = Just (grounded - flying)</code></pre>

<p>Let’s try this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; land 3 0
Just 3
&gt; land 4 0
Nothing
&gt; takeoff 2 0
Nothing
&gt; takeoff 1 2
Just 1</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a problem because we can no longer chain our <code>land</code> and
<code>takeoff</code> methods together easily. They both return a <code>Maybe Airport</code>,
but they take in <code>Airport</code>. We can try to write a function to take care
of this.</p>
<pre class='haskell'><code class='haskell'>chain :: Maybe Airport -&gt; (Airport -&gt; Maybe Airport) -&gt; Maybe Airport
chain Nothing _ = Nothing
chain (Just grounded) action = action grounded</code></pre>

<p>And we can now write things smoothly</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Just 1 `chain` takeoff 1 `chain` land 2 `chain` takeoff 2
Just 0</code></pre>

<p>And if we just change the name of <code>chain</code> to <code>&gt;&gt;=</code></p>
<pre class='haskell'><code class='haskell'>&gt; Just 1 &gt;&gt;= takeoff 2
Nothing
&gt; Just 2 &gt;&gt;= takeoff 1
Just 1</code></pre>

<p>There we have it, the <code>bind</code> operator in Monads!</p>
