<h1 class="title">Algebraic structures</h1>
<h3 class="date">2017-05-03 16:06</h3>
</div>
<p>I have encountered these <em>algebraic structures</em> in my readings often, but can't seem to remember them. I hope that jotting them down in this manner will help me to recall and recognize the patterns.</p>
<p>The list of algebraic structures here are in order from most general (less requirements) to least general (more requirements).</p>
<p>These structures are also called <em>group-like</em>, because they similar to a <em>group</em> (which is a structure we will get to), but with either more or less requirements.</p>
<h1 id="group-like-algebraic-structures">Group-like algebraic structures</h1>
<p>A group-like algebraic structure is made up of 2 components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A set of elements, <em><code>A</code></em></li>
<li>An operation, <code>•</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The operation combines any two elements in the set to form a third element: given the elements <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, you can combine them to get <code>a • b</code>.</p>
<p>Below I will list out the different kinds of structures classified as group-like, and enumerate requirements the structure must fulfill.</p>
<h2 id="magma">Magma</h2>
<p>A magma is the simplest structure: the operation only has 1 requirement, which is</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure, for any <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, <code>a • b</code> must be in the set of elements</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, you can never get out of this structure by applying operations.</p>
<h2 id="semigroup">Semigroup</h2>
<p>A semigroup is a magma with 1 more requirement on the operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associativity, which is that for any <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, <code>(a • b) • c = a • (b • c)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The order in which the operation is applied does not matter, as long as the order of the operands stay the same.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>The set of positive integers with addition as the operation.</p>
<p>Let the set <code>A</code> be the set of positive integers: 1, 2, ..., and the operation be <code>+</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure is satisfied: <code>a + b</code> is still a positive integer in <code>A</code></li>
<li>Associativity is satisfied: <code>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</code>, since <code>+</code> is associative</li>
</ul>
<p>Mnemonic: semi is half, half is 1/<strong>2</strong>, so a semigroup has <strong>2</strong> requirements.</p>
<h2 id="monoid">Monoid</h2>
<p>A monoid is a semigroup with 1 more requirement on the set of elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity, there must be an identity element, <code>e</code>, such that for all <code>a</code>, <code>e • a = a = a • e</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, an operation applied to the identity effectively does nothing.</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>The set of natural numbers with addition as the operation, 0 as the identity.</p>
<p>Let the set <code>A</code> be the set of natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, ..., and the operation be <code>+</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure and associativity are satisfied, see semigroup</li>
<li>Identity is satisfied with 0 as the identity element: <code>0 + a = a = a + 0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Mnemonic: Mono<strong>i</strong>d, the <strong>i</strong> is for identity</p>
<h2 id="group">Group</h2>
<p>A group is a monoid with 1 more requirement on the set of elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inverse, for every <code>a</code> in the set, there is an inverse <code>-a</code>, such that <code>a • -a = -a • a = e</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the operation to an element an its inverse gives you the identity, they cancel out.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example</h3>
<p>The set of integers with addition as the operation, 0 as the identity, the inverse of each integer is its negation.</p>
<p>Let the set <code>A</code> be the set of integers: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., and the operation be <code>+</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure, associativity, and identity are satisfied, see monoid</li>
<li>Inverse is satisfied with <code>-a</code> being the inverse of <code>a</code>: <code>a + -a = -a + a = 0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(Observe that the set of integers can form a group with another operation: multiplication, and 1 as the identity)</p>
<h2 id="abelian-group">Abelian group</h2>
<p>An Abelian group is a group with 1 more requirement on the operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commutativity, for all <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, <code>a • b = b • a</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we had some restricted form of this in monoids (for the identity) and in groups (for inverses). This restriction now extends to all elements in the set.</p>
<h3 id="example-3">Example</h3>
<p>The set of integers with addition as the operation, 0 as the identity, negation as the inverse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure, associativity, identity, and inverse are satisfied, see group</li>
<li>Commutativity is is satisfied <code>a + b = b + a</code>, since <code>+</code> is commutative</li>
</ul>
