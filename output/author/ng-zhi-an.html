                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Recently I've been trying out problems on <a href="codeforces.com">codeforces</a> to practice my algorithms and data structure problem solving skills.</p>
<p>This is a good chance to revise a language I know but haven't used for a while, or to pick up a new language.
For me it was a chance to write some <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.</p>
<p>The particular problem I was working on is <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/B">1B</a>.
Take a minute to read it, it's an interesting problem.</p>
<p>In summary, there are 2 numeration systems, and if we are given <em>system A</em>, we need to translate it to <em>system B</em>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>I chose to write a function that decides if a given string belongs to system A.
The function signature is simple.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nf">isA</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>This post is about Assignment 1 on on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers">Coursera Compilers course</a>, which is to write a flex specification for lexing COOL.</p>
<p>This was pretty challenging for me, I took about 4 hours in total, spread over a couple of nights to complete this.</p>
<p>The challenging part was handling edge cases, and thinking about how the lexer will match strings. For example, because the lexer matches greedily, an over-optimistic regex will cause group that you won't think of capturing to be captured.</p>
<p>The really helpful part was running the grading script, and checking the differences between the reference lexer and my lexer. This allowed me to drill down to specific portions of my regex or code, such as areas I should be increasing the line count.</p>

It was easy making a screencast, Camstudio was a free and easy way to record a particular window, the problem is converting it into a gif.</p>
<p>I've heard quite a bit about <code>ffmpeg</code> as a swiss army knife for manipulating videos, so I decided to try it out.</p>
<p>ffmpeg can be downloaded from its <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">homepage</a>, and the documentation is available <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>My laptop runs Windows 8.1 64bit, and I do my development in a Vagrant environment with a VirtualBox provider.
I really like this setup, until it craps on me. This post documents some commone error I face and what I did to fix (or maybe not fix) it.</p>
<h2>Vagrant lost my old development environment omgomgomg!</h2>
<p>Vagrant uses the UUID of a VirtualBox managed box to identify which vagrant environment is tied to which VirtualBox.
Vagrant stores this UUID in a file called <code>id</code> and this file is located in the <code>.vagrant</code> directory which is located beside the <code>Vagrantfile</code>.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>As part of <a href="../what-the-heck-is-google-closure-compiler.html">the series</a> exploring the internals of Google Closure Compiler, this time we are diving into one of the many optimizations that it does, the peephole optimization.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/0f7da6bca71de86ea949fcec45ee8db699a3af45/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/AbstractPeepholeOptimization.java#L22-L28">code itself</a> describes peephole optimizations as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>optimizations that look at a small section of code and either remove
that code (if it is not needed) or replaces it with smaller code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In compiler theory, peephole optimization is a kind of optimization performed over a very small set of instructions in a segment of generated code. The set is called a &gt; "peephole" or a "window". It works by recognising sets of instructions that can be replaced by shorter or faster sets of instructions.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler">GitHub repo</a>, closure compiler does many amazing things:</p>
<ul>
<li>parses your JavaScript,</li>
<li>analyzes it,</li>
<li>removes dead code and rewrites</li>
<li>minimizes what's left</li>
<li>checks syntax, variable references, and types,</li>
<li>and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls</li>
</ul>
<p>That's pretty complicated. But no fear, this series will explore the Closure Compiler, one feature at a time.</p>
<p>Let's follow their instructions and try to run it from the command line.</p>

<p>The output we get is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>var x=42;

<p>What noticeable differences are there?</p>

<li><code>17 + 25</code> became <code>42</code></li>

<p>Born out of around 20 hours of hacking (18 of which was while standing), I built <a href="http://128.199.204.208/">Suggest</a>, a tool that analyzes what has been written so far and tries to grab articles that are relevant.</p>
