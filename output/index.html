                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Sometimes I have a little bit of trouble getting my development setup to work properly.</p>
<p>My laptop runs Windows 8.1 64bit, and I do my development in a Vagrant environment with a VirtualBox provider.
I really like this setup, until it craps on me. This post documents some commone error I face and what I did to fix (or maybe not fix) it.</p>
<h2>Vagrant lost my old development environment omgomgomg!</h2>
<p>Vagrant uses the UUID of a VirtualBox managed box to identify which vagrant environment is tied to which VirtualBox.
Vagrant stores this UUID in a file called <code>id</code> and this file is located in the <code>.vagrant</code> directory which is located beside the <code>Vagrantfile</code>.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>As part of <a href="./what-the-heck-is-google-closure-compiler.html">the series</a> exploring the internals of Google Closure Compiler, this time we are diving into one of the many optimizations that it does, the peephole optimization.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/0f7da6bca71de86ea949fcec45ee8db699a3af45/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/AbstractPeepholeOptimization.java#L22-L28">code itself</a> describes peephole optimizations as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>optimizations that look at a small section of code and either remove
that code (if it is not needed) or replaces it with smaller code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In compiler theory, peephole optimization is a kind of optimization performed over a very small set of instructions in a segment of generated code. The set is called a &gt; "peephole" or a "window". It works by recognising sets of instructions that can be replaced by shorter or faster sets of instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>A couple of days ago I decided to get my JavaScript development environment in order.</p>
<p>I haven't been doing much JS dev lately, mostly just tweaking a tiny bit of JS, but I had just received a pure frontend JS task. So I thought it would be a good time to do so!</p>
<p>I live in Vim world, and these instructions are assembled from various places all over the web.</p>
<p>Here's how my setup looks like right now</p>

<h1>Syntax highlighting</h1>
<p>First thing I wanted was syntax highlighting, and I usually just head to GitHub to do a search.</p>
<p>I found a couple of vim scripts for this, and I chose [this] (https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) because it was the most recently updated, and had the most number ...</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>It "compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript", so why would any one want that?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler">GitHub repo</a>, closure compiler does many amazing things:</p>
<ul>
<li>parses your JavaScript,</li>
<li>analyzes it,</li>
<li>removes dead code and rewrites</li>
<li>minimizes what's left</li>
<li>checks syntax, variable references, and types,</li>
<li>and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls</li>
</ul>
<p>That's pretty complicated. But no fear, this series will explore the Closure Compiler, one feature at a time.</p>
<p>Let's follow their instructions and try to run it from the command line.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>java -jar build/compiler.jar
var <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">17</span> + 25<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The output we get is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>var x=42;
</pre></div>


<p>What noticeable differences are there?</p>
<ol>
<li><code>17 + 25</code> became <code>42</code></li>
<li>Space between and after <code>=</code> is gone</li>
</ol>
<p>So even for this simple one liner, closure compiler has managed to run 2 ...</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
