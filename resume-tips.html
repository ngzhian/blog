        Resume tips
        </h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
        <p>These tips are targeted towards college students looking for internships/jobs in the tech sector.
It probably is still useful for anyone writing a resume.</p>
<h2 id="Length">Length</h2>

<p>Keep it short, 1 page is good, 2 is a stretch.</p>
<p>Write concise points, 2 - 3 bullet points for each paragraph, please don&#39;t write essays.</p>
<h2 id="Content">Content</h2>

<p>Keep things relevant, they don&#39;t need to know everything about you.
Discard information that is not related to the role you are applying for.</p>
<p>Use numbers to quantify and highlight your accomplishments,
for example, 2x speed improvement, 10 hours saved.</p>
<p>Include a line that lists technology that you are knowledgeable in -
if this was buzzword scrabble this line would have over 9000 points.</p>
<h2 id="Format">Format</h2>

<p>Include context, link to your social profiles (GitHub, LinkedIN), projects, websites -
it makes it easier, or even encourages, the recruiter to browse.</p>
<p>Format things properly, be consistent,
but don&#39;t <strong>go</strong> <em>crazy</em> with DIFFERENT styles that makes things unreadable</p>
<h2 id="Check">Check</h2>

<p>Read through your resume many times, make sure there are no errors.</p>
<p>Pretend you&#39;re the recruiter, will you accept this applicant?</p>
<p>Keep updating your resume!
For example when you first graduate you probably won&#39;t have a lot of work experience,
so you can talk more about your education, co-curricular activities, side projects, etc.
But replace them as you gain more internship/work experience.</p>
<h2 id="Submit">Submit</h2>

<p>Actually send your resume.
This is probably the hardest step.
It&#39;s scary, but hey, if you want the job, you have to do it.
The more you do it, the less scary it becomes, so here&#39;s <a href='http://resume.ngzhian.com'>mine</a>.</p>
