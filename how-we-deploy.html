<p>This is a series of posts for my CS3216 project, you can find the original post <a href="https://medium.com/@ngzhian/how-we-deploy-4a43a2cb7f45#.wbq5pkezp">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bubble is made up of 4 main components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backend, this handles all the chat connections, i.e. socket.io connections, database</li>
<li>Web app, this is <a href="https://app.getbubblechat.com">https://app.getbubblechat.com</a></li>
<li>Landing page, <a href="https://getbubblechat.com">https://getbubblechat.com</a></li>
<li>Android app</li>
</ol>
<p>All these components have a separate repository and can be deployed individually.</p>
<p>I work primarily on the backend, and early on in the development I decided to host the backend online in an EC2 instance. This has various advantages: my team mates can now develop the front end without running the back end server, and can also interact with an instance already populated with dummy data.</p>
<p>During peak development periods, I would deploy the backend multiple times a day — as my team mates develop, they find bugs or have suggestions on how to improve the back end, and I would code it up and deploy. This motivated me to come up with a deployment strategy that is, in my opinion: simple and easy.</p>
<p>Here is the current iteration of my deployment script that lives in the production box. (Unfortunately I did not check this into version control, so I cannot share how this script evolved from a simple 2 liner into the 10 lines, which still isn’t that much that has primitive supports for backup.) The deploy script is relatively straightforward, and I have annotated this script heavily for the purpose of this post.</p>
<pre><code># deploy.sh
# goes into the right directory, and pwd for sanity checking
cd bubble
pwd
# pull master (we also have travis-ci set up for master)
# https://travis-ci.org/CS3216-Bubble/bubble
# and install any new deps (npm-shrinkwrap to lock deps)
# https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap
git pull
npm install --no-progress
# remove any old backups lying around
if [ -f ./dist-prev ]; then
  rm -rf ./dist-prev
fi
# build fails when we lock fsevents
# the problem occurs because I develop on a mac,
# and shrinkwrap generates a fsevents version for mac
# but our prod instance is a fedora, and it grabs the wrong
# version of fsevents.
# since npm-shrinkwrap.json doesn&#39;t change much, I manually edit it.
# https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2679
grep &#39;fsevents&#39; npm-shrinkwrap.json &amp;&amp; (echo &quot;remove fsevents from shrinkwrap&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1)
# back up current working dist, allows for easy recovery
# in case the new build causes problems
cp -r dist/ dist-prev/
# finally build, this will compile our app into dist/
npm run build
# reserve and serve are npm run scripts that call into forever,
# it restarts a script if running, else it starts it
# https://github.com/foreverjs/forever
npm run reserve || npm run serve</code></pre>
<p>My deployment step is then:</p>
<pre><code>ssh bubble # ssh into production box, set this up in .ssh/config
./deploy.sh # the same script as above</code></pre>
<p>I could have added a script to do automatic rollback as well, but I figured I don’t do rollbacks often enough (have only done it once so far). Besides, we have travis-ci set up anyway so we will know when master is broken.</p>
<p>This deployment strategy is simple, easy to understand, and has worked really well for my team. I use the same strategy for the other components as well, a simple script that does <code>git pull</code>, runs any build step, and optionally copies built files into another directory (such as the landing page so nginx can serve those files). How does your team do deployment?</p>
