<h2 id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>I was in the bathroom, after watching a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBJ3hdcM7G8'>video on
Kata</a>, and fiddling with
the thought of doing a Kata using Haskell. So I thought of what Kata I
could try, and figured that a Scissors Paper Stone kata would be cool. I
would have a chance to practice IO, hence Monads, and also some simple
logic. So that led to the thought of how a game of SPS may work out…</p>
<h2 id="ScissorsPaperStone">Scissors Paper Stone</h2>

<p>Now you probably know the game and <a href='http://worldrps.com/game-basics'>how it’s
played</a>. Scissors beats Paper, Paper
beats Stone, Stone beats Scissors. Hmm what? If we plot how powerful
each Move is, we see this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Stone
&gt;&gt;&gt; Paper
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Scissors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stone   // what???</code></pre><p>This is interesting because, given a list of Scissors, Paper, and Stone,
how would the result look like?</p>
<p>Eventually I went to research a bit more, sometimes you just got to know
what search terms to type, and I found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order'>cyclic
ordering</a>. It even
classifies Scissors Paper Stone as a Discrete Cycle. But that didn’t
stop me from wondering what sorting them will look like!</p>
<h2 id="Code">Code</h2>

<p>So I went ahead to explore. Code given is in Java, my most familiar
lanugage. Code is ugly because, well its ugly. Maybe I should try to use
polymorphism to clean it up… hm… Anyway, the <a href='https://gist.github.com/ngzhian/11373536' title='GitHub Gist for this experiment'>gist is
here</a></p>
<pre><code> {.sourceCode .java}
static class Move implements Comparable&lt;Move&gt; {
  public enum TYPE {
    SCISSORS, PAPER, STONE
  };

  public static int COUNT = 0;
  private TYPE type;
  private int count;

  private static Move paper() {
    Move move = new Move();
    move.type = TYPE.PAPER;
    move.count = COUNT++;
    return move;
  }

  private static Move scissors() {
    Move move = new Move();
    move.type = TYPE.SCISSORS;
    move.count = COUNT++;
    return move;
  }

  private static Move stone() {
    Move move = new Move();
    move.type = TYPE.STONE;
    move.count = COUNT++;
    return move;
  }

  public String toString() {
    switch (type) {
      case SCISSORS:
        return &quot;Scissors [&quot; + count + &quot;]&quot;;
      case PAPER:
        return &quot;Paper [&quot; + count + &quot;]&quot;;
      case STONE:
        return &quot;Stone [&quot; + count + &quot;]&quot;;
    }
    return &quot;&quot;;
  }

  @Override
  public int compareTo(Move o) {
    switch (this.type) {
      case SCISSORS:
        switch (o.type) {
          case SCISSORS:
            return 0;
          case PAPER:
            return 1;
          case STONE:
            return -1;
        }
      case PAPER:
        switch (o.type) {
          case SCISSORS:
            return -1;
          case PAPER:
            return 0;
          case STONE:
            return 1;
        }
      case STONE:
        switch (o.type) {
          case SCISSORS:
            return 1;
          case PAPER:
            return -1;
          case STONE:
            return 0;
        }
  }
  return 0;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>This is how the <code>Move</code> class looks like, and <code>compareTo</code> basically has
the rules for the entire game. After this it was just making an outer
class to add <code>Move</code>s to a list and to use <code>Collections.sort</code> on them:</p>
<pre><code> {.sourceCode .java}
public class ScissorsPaperStone {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List&lt;Move&gt; list = new Vector&lt;Move&gt;();

    for (Move move : list) {
      System.out.print(move + &quot;, &quot;);
    }
    System.out.println();

    Collections.sort(list);

    for (Move move : list) {
      System.out.print(move + &quot;, &quot;);
    }
    System.out.println();
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>The results are definitely sorted, if we look at them pairwise. For
example in the somehwat random sequence, every pair of <code>Move</code>s is sored,
but we can see that the 2nd element is <code>Scissors</code>, but the last element
is a <code>Paper</code>, and clearly Paper does not beat Scissors.</p>
<p>Another observation is that, sequences that are already sorted don’t
change. For example, Paper-Scissors-Stone is already in order, so the
whole sequence is sorted, and hence doesn’t change. But I’m not sure how
to explain the resuts for the rest, especially for the somewhat random
sequence.</p>
<p>But I wanted to know a bit more about how Java does sorting, and so I
went to a bit of digging and jotted my discoveries
