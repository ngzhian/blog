        <p>A couple of days ago I decided to get my JavaScript development environment in order.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been doing much JS dev lately, mostly just tweaking a tiny bit of JS, but I had just received a pure frontend JS task. So I thought it would be a good time to do so!</p>
<p>I live in Vim world, and these instructions are assembled from various places all over the web.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how my setup looks like right now</p>
<p><img src='http://i.imgur.com/JjT5XW2.png' alt='My Vim JavaScript setup, with d3.js code' /></p>
<h1 id="Syntaxhighlighting">Syntax highlighting</h1>

<p>First thing I wanted was syntax highlighting, and I usually just head to GitHub to do a search.</p>
<p>I found a couple of vim scripts for this, and I chose [this] (https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) because it was the most recently updated, and had the most number of stars.</p>
<p>As I used <a href='https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim'>Vundle</a>, this was as easy as adding a line to my <code>.vimrc</code></p>
<pre class='vim'><code class='vim'>Plugin &quot;pangloss/vim-javascript&quot;</code></pre>

<h1 id="Indentation">Indentation</h1>

<p>From my observation, 2 spaces seems to be pretty popular, so I went with that as well.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t require any plugin, Vim has really good support for smart indentations built in, we just need to which command does it!</p>
<p>In this case refering to <code>.vimrc</code> files of experienced vim users really helps. One notable Vim (and Ruby) expert I really like is <a href='https://github.com/r00k/'>Ben Orenstein</a>. Thanks Ben!</p>
<p>I went to <a href='https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc#L59-72'>his dotfiles</a> and found the lines that was releveant, which was the <code>autocmd</code> command, <a href='http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html#:autocmd'>docs</a></p>
<pre><code>autocmd FileType javascript setlocal sw=2</code></pre>

<p><code>autocmd</code> basically sets some settings when you open a file of a specific type.</p>
<p>So for the setting aove, everytime you open a <code>javascript</code> file, it will set the <code>shiftwidth</code> to 2 locally (i.e. only the current buffer or window), <a href='http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#:setlocal'>docs on setlocal</a>, <a href='http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#&#39;shiftwidth&#39;'>docs on shiftwidth</a></p>
<p>Check out my own <code>.vimrc</code> <a href='https://github.com/ngzhian/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc'>here</a></p>
<h1 id="Lintingstylechecks">Linting, style checks</h1>

<p>Linting is really helpful and we should always have it turned on.</p>
<p>It helps captures stupid typos which would result in undefined references, breaking the page. It also ensures that you write code that is formatted consistently.</p>
<p>And there are many other reasons as well!</p>
<p>A helpful resource was <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/473478/vim-jslint/5893447#5893447'>this stackoverflow question</a>, and I basically followed the instruction on one of those answer.</p>
<p>First, install <a href='https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic'>Syntastic</a>, which is an amazing, flexible syntax checker for Vim. It works really well and is extensible, so you can plug in different checkers for each file type.</p>
<p>For JavaScript, there are multiple checkers available, one that I chose was <a href='http://jshint.com/docs/'>jshint</a></p>
<p>This is easy to install, assuming you have <code>npm</code></p>
<pre class='sh'><code class='sh'>npm install jshint -g</code></pre>

<p>Restart Vim, and Syntastic will automatically pick up jshint.</p>
<p>Open up a JavaScript file, then use this ex command <code>:SyntasticInfo</code> to verify that <code>jshint</code> is indeed active.</p>
<p>Another checker worth looking at is Google&#39;s <a href='https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto'>closure library linter</a>. This is particularly interesting because just a couple of days ago I was exploring the Google Closure Compiler, <a href='{filename}/closure-compiler-1.mdown'>here&#39;s my blog post on it.</a></p>
