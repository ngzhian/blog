# By experience level

  haven't been there for a long time)
- Intermediate: Boruda, BFF Bendemeer, Boulder+, Boulder Planet
- Advanced: Lighthouse, Boulder+, Boulder Planet

# Visiting

If you are visiting Singapore and want to climb, you are probably an advanced
or humble intermediate climber. As such, you will enjoy any gyms marked
advanced above.

Lighthouse has the most comprehensive training area and system boards. For
serious training, go there. The route-setting is complex and hard as well.

BFF Bendemeer gets a good crowd of people with all sorts of levels (though you
will find the stronger climbers huddling at the Moon boards). If you are in for
small talk I find this to be a chatty community.

Boulder+ Chevrons and Boulder Planet Sembawang are the most spacious with
scattered routes. They have more modern route-setting, so if you like jumpy
jump, pick one of those. Boulder+ Chevrons has the highest wall, However, these
gyms are a bit far from the city central, so their other branches (Boulder+
Aperia Mall and Boulder Planet Tai Seng) can give you a similar experience.

## Disclaimer

I offer my take on mapping each gym's grade to V scale. For comparison, I've
been climbing since 2020, my max grade at Dogpatch Boulders (San Francisco) is
V10 (2 routes, double digit sessions on each). My max grade outdoors is V7 ([Go
Granny Ho][gogrannyho], Grandma Peabody Boulder, Bishop, CA) (I don't go out
very often).

My max grades at each gym is:

- BFF: 15
- Boulder+: Black
- Boruda: 1D
- Boulder Planer: 11
- Ground Up: V8
- Climba: Red
- Lighthouse: 8
