<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) can be made more accurate by increasing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>depth</li>
<li>width</li>
<li>resolution</li>
</ol>
<p>Scaling up any of these dimensions requires more processing power (FLOPS).</p>
<p>This paper suggests that these dimensions are interdependent, and scaling all of them in a balanced manner will lead to better accuracy while using less resources. The paper suggests a way to perform such scaling, known as a compound coefficient. The paper then uses neural architecture search to design a baseline model, then scale it up using compound coefficient to obtain a family of networks known as EfficientNet.</p>
<p>Scaling each of the dimensions is a way to gain accuracy, but scaling too much leads to difficulties in training. The accuracy gains also diminishes quickly (for the amount of resources required).</p>
<p>Experiments in this paper shows that scaling just width without changing depth or resolution leads to accuracy saturating quickly. With a deeper network and higher resolution, the width scaling results in higher accuracy with the same cost.</p>
<p>The compound coefficient uniformly scales depth, width, and resolution. It can be thought of as how much resources can be dedicated to scale the model.</p>
<p>EfficientNet family of models (B0 to B7) was found by:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the compound coefficient to 1, and do a grid search for depth, width, and resolution scale to use (1.2, 1.1, 1.15 respectively)</li>
<li>fix depth, width, and resolution scale, then scale up the compound coefficient</li>
</ul>
