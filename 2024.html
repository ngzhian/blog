<p>At a recent friend gathering, it was suggested that everyone present
some slides about their 2024. This method puts one person completely in
the spotlight, allowing the group to get to know someone deeply. This
has much more depth compare to other social gatherings, where
conversations usually are about surface-level topics.</p>
<p>I made some slides as well, and decided to convert it into a post
format, mostly for archival purposes.</p>

<p>The biggest reason for our move back to Singapore was to be closer to
our family and friends, to spend more time with them. In 2024, we had
nearly weekly meals with both my family and my in-laws, and also
frequently had combined meals. We have managed to catch up with many
group of friends, and I even made a new group of friends and travelled
with them.</p>
<p>Based on my calendar, I ran on 129 occasions and climbed 88 times.
Roughly, I exercised on 59% of days in 2024. This is just above half the
time, and in 2025 I would like to exercise more. My work is sendantary,
so all physical exertion is outside of usual 9-5. Exercise is not just
important for keeping physically healthy, my mood also improves when I
exercise.</p>
<p>Running was usually a <a
href="https://www.ngzhian.com/goals-2018.html">solo activity</a>, but in
2024 my wife joined me on many occasions. I also have weekly runs with
my colleagues.</p>
<p><a href="bouldering-singapore.html">Climbing</a> has been a big part
of my life since 2019. In 2024, it became a way for me to spend more
time, connect, and become closer with my sister. Climbing also expanded
my social circle, I met many colleagues at work due to this hobby, and a
number of them became friends.</p>
<p>I read 42 books in 2024. For me, reading is a form of entertainment
and enjoyment. I don’t take copious notes nor write summaries or reviews
of the books I read. Actually, I don’t retain much information from my
reading. My current reading diet consists of a lot of fantasy, by <a

Sanderson</a>.</p>
<p>I watch a lot of YouTube, mostly climbing, with some sci + math
sprinkled in. These are my favourite math/sci/learning channels:</p>
<ul>

grids, bridges)</li>

<p>In 2024, my partner had a health issue involving multiple operations
and treatment. She is well now, but is a stark reminder that life can be
unpredictable. The message that I want to take into 2025 is to cherish
and to care: cherish the moments you have, cherish the people around
you; care for yourself, your body, your mind, and also take care of one
another.</p>
