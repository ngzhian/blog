<p>Couple of weeks ago, I received great news that my project with
<a href='http://ganglia.sourceforge.net'>Ganglia</a> has been accepted into GSOC.
I’m extremely glad to be given this opportunity to participate in open
source, it’s a dream come true for me.</p>
<h2 id="jmxetricis">jmxetric is…</h2>

<p>My project is on <a href='http://github.com/ganglia/jmxetric'>jmxetric</a>, which
is a jvm instrumentation to ganglia.</p>
<h2 id="Theplans">The plans</h2>

<p>A rough overview of my plan is to improve the current current
implementation, fix outstanding issues, and implement more features. The
<em>more features</em> part include support for popular Java software, such as
HornetQ, Karaf, Tomcat, and Wildfly.</p>
<p>This is quite a challenge for me because I’ve not been exposed to Java
EE technologies, and most of these buzzwords are foreign to me. But I’m
confident that I will pick them up pretty fast, and am very fortunate to
have an extremely patient mentor, Daniel to guide me.</p>
<h2 id="Thisseries">This series</h2>

<p>I’ve decided, having been inspired by other GSOC students, to document
this entire journey in a series of blog posts tagged <strong>gsoc</strong>. This
series will chronicle every detail of this experience, including what I
learn, pitfalls, reflections.</p>
<h2 id="Thankyou">Thank you</h2>

<p>Once again, thank you Google, Ganglia, and Daniel for this extremely
rare chance. I’ll work hard and do my best for this project! Here’s to a
fantastic summer :)</p>
