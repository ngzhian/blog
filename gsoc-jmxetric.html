<p>Couple of weeks ago, I received great news that my project with <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net">Ganglia</a> has been accepted into GSOC. I’m extremely glad to be given this opportunity to participate in open source, it’s a dream come true for me.</p>
<h2 id="jmxetric-is">jmxetric is…</h2>
<p>My project is on <a href="http://github.com/ganglia/jmxetric">jmxetric</a>, which is a jvm instrumentation to ganglia.</p>
<h2 id="the-plans">The plans</h2>
<p>A rough overview of my plan is to improve the current current implementation, fix outstanding issues, and implement more features. The <em>more features</em> part include support for popular Java software, such as HornetQ, Karaf, Tomcat, and Wildfly.</p>
<p>This is quite a challenge for me because I’ve not been exposed to Java EE technologies, and most of these buzzwords are foreign to me. But I’m confident that I will pick them up pretty fast, and am very fortunate to have an extremely patient mentor, Daniel to guide me.</p>
<h2 id="this-series">This series</h2>
<p>I’ve decided, having been inspired by other GSOC students, to document this entire journey in a series of blog posts tagged <strong>gsoc</strong>. This series will chronicle every detail of this experience, including what I learn, pitfalls, reflections.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>Once again, thank you Google, Ganglia, and Daniel for this extremely rare chance. I’ll work hard and do my best for this project! Here’s to a fantastic summer :)</p>
