<p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare69.pdf">Paper (pdf)</a> <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/10/42360-retrospective-an-axiomatic-basis-for-computer-programming/fulltext">40th anniversary retrospective</a></p>
<p>In this paper, C. A. R. Hoare explores the mathematical logic underlying computer programming.</p>
<p>All state and results of running programs should be informed by <em>deductive reasoning</em>. Deductive reasoning consists of <em>axioms</em>, and <em>rules of inferences</em> on this set of axioms.</p>
<p>Some axioms that he lays out include the rules of arithmetic: commutativity of addition and multiplication etc.</p>
<p>Computers have certain limitations, such as not being able to represent infinitely many numbers (which mathematics can). An example is overflow, it could result in one of three cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strict - a program that overflows never completes</li>
<li>Boundary - represent by the maximum value</li>
<li>Modulo - modulo the representable set of integers</li>
</ol>
<p>By choosing one of these overflow technique and representing it as an axiom will allow us to continue using deductive reasoning.</p>
<p>To represent the connection between a precondition, a program, and the resulting state of execution, he introduces:</p>
<pre><code>P { Q } R</code></pre>
<p>where P is the precondition, Q is the program, and R is the resulting state (Hoare triples).</p>
<p>Then, an axiom and three inference rules are laid down so as to apply deductive reasoning to program execution.</p>
<p>The axiom “Axiom of Assignment” represents variable assignments that we commonly use in programming languages.</p>
<p>The “Rule of Consequence” is logical implication:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>if <code>P { Q } R</code> and <code>R -&gt; S</code>, then <code>P { Q } S</code></li>
<li>if <code>P { Q } R</code> and <code>S -&gt; P</code>, then <code>S { Q } R</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The “Rule of Composition” allows for composing two triples by sequencing program execution:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>if <code>P { Q1 } R1</code> and <code>Rr { Q2 } R</code>, then <code>P { Q1; Q2 } R</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The “Rule of Iteration” states that the test condition will not be true after the while loop is completed, and any other precondition remains true:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>if <code>P and B { S } P</code> then <code>P { while B do S } not B and P</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, these inference rules assume that execution is side effect free.</p>
<p>Also, the axioms and rules do not guarantee successful termination of the program, e.g. you can have an infinite loop in the iteration rule.</p>
<p>He notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the practice of supplying proofs for nontrivial programs will not become widespread until considerably more powerful proof techniques become available”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think right now we are in a period where proof assistants are becoming much more accessible, and companies generally use formal verification methods on critical software.</p>
<p>Some notes on how testing is done, which is manual testing by a programmer on subset of cases (poor man unit testing). Notes that errors discovered at this stage costs a lot, and even more when errors are discovered after the program is in use (shipped).</p>
<p>Proving programs can also help with documentation. A proof will describe accurately the preconditions and postconditions, so any caller can rely on this as a lemma. Also, you get <em>referential transparency</em>, where two programs that are provably correct and satisfy the same interface (preconditions and postconditions).</p>
