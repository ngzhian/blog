<p>I started on this because I wanted to use unicode characters for
<a href='https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar'>LemonBoy’s bar</a>. I wanted to display
funky symbols without installing a new font, so I decided to use Dejavu
Sans Mono to display them.</p>
<p>I had to get bar to find my font, and that is the gist of this post. In
X, a font is specified in a funny way. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><code>-misc-dejavu sans mono-medium-r-normal--17-120-100-100-m-100-iso10646-1</code></p>
<p>Most of the time though, we will not need to be so specific, can this
will do:</p>
<p><code>-*-dejavu sans mono-medium-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1</code></p>
<p>If you’re as curious as me you’ll probably want to find out what all
those numbers as me, and if you’re as stupid too, you’ld probably spend
an entire afternoon finding out.</p>
<p>If you’re just interested in the answer jump to the bottom, ’cos I will
be going though steps to find this information yourself.</p>
<p><code>xlsfonts</code> is is the server font list displayer for X
(<code>man xlsfonts</code>) This is the most crucial thing we need. Get it from
your distribution’s package manager, I’m on arch so I just had to</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S xlsfonts</code></pre>

<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>xlsfonts</code></pre>

<p>You should see a bunch of fonts displayed similar to what I showed you
above.</p>
<p>If you have DejaVu Sans already installed you can probably try this:</p>
<pre><code>xlsfonts -l -fn -misc-dejavu sans 
mono-medium-r-normal–17-120-100-100-m-100-iso10646-1</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you type the backslash as well, you have to escape the spaces.</p>
<p>If not you, pick a font from the list generated by <code>xlsfonts</code>, and do:</p>
<pre><code>xlsfonts -l -fn -the-font-you-picked-some-numbers-blah-blah111</code></pre><p>Or if you’re lazy to type we can just select the first font in the list:</p>
<pre><code>xlsfonts -l -fn $(xlsfonts | head -1)</code></pre><p>Now thats not very interesting, a bunch of short cryptic headings, so lets try this:</p>
<pre><code>xlsfonts -ll -fn \$(xlsfonts | head -1)</code></pre><p>Note the 2 l’s this time. So this gets much more interesting, lots of
information, not that difficult to understand. Most are
self-explanatory, such as direction, rows, columns. To go more in-depth,
try these search terms: character encoding, character map, fonts in x.</p>
<p>Now things become clearer, lets separate the full font name by hypens,
and match them to the properties in the output:</p>
<table>

  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>SLANT has to do with the italics, r stands for Roman, there is also o
for Oblique. Mystery solved! I don’t know what every property means, but
I guess you can probably find out if you want to</p>
<p>This worked for <code>bar</code>, with the specific full font name. I also learned
that the <code>PIXEL_SIZE</code> and <code>POINT_SIZE</code> should not both be set at the
same time. For example, looking at the information above, you can set
<code>PIXEL_SIZE</code> and <code>POINT_SIZE</code> to 17 and 120 respectively, but 12 and 120
will fail.</p>
<p>I suppose this has something to do with font rasterizing, so setting one
will optimize the other for you. As such I chose to fidget with
<code>PIXEL_SIZE</code> and leave <code>POINT_SIZE</code> as *.</p>
<p>What I’m using now is this:</p>
<pre><code>-misc-dejavu sans mono-medium-r-normal--11-*-*-*-m-*-iso10646-1&quot;</code></pre><p>Which ensures that I get the correct font family, weight, encoding,
which I guess are the most important parts, just leave the rest to the
computer!</p>
<p>Notes: <code>xlsfonts</code> has a <code>-lll</code> flag to, shows you every character in the
font, pretty crazy and useful at the same time! And guess what I think
I’ll be back to stlarch so it looks so much better.</p>
