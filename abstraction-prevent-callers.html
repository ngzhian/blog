<p>When writing a long, complicated piece of code, it is ideal to add comment to pieces of the logic, some will say that every commented snippet should be extracted into a function. There is a tension between extracting into smaller functions, and keep ensuring that those extracted functions only get called with the correct prerequisite.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>if (match(a)) {
  if (deepermatch(a)) {
    // optimized code
  } else {
    // less optimized code
  }
}</code></pre>
<p><code>deepermatch</code> allows us to write a more optimized implementation, provided that <code>a</code> meets certain requirements. However, the condition is that <code>match(a)</code> needs to be true already.</p>
<p>In order words, calling <code>deepermatch(a)</code> outside the scope of a <code>match(a)</code> will lead to incorrect results.</p>
<p>One way to disallow this is to use private members inside a class.</p>
<pre><code>class A {
  public match();
  private deepermatch()
}</code></pre>
<p>This exposes only <code>match</code>, so no caller can use <code>deepermatch</code>. But with this, there is an inversion of control. The caller can no longer easily write a more optimized code when <code>deepermatch</code> is true. It needs to somehow supply the logic to <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>Another way is of course, commenting your code:</p>
<pre><code>match()
// Only call this if `match` is true.
deepermatch()</code></pre>
<p>This is however, fragile.</p>
<p>We could also, in the definition of <code>deepermatch</code>, call <code>match</code>.</p>
<pre><code>deepermatch() {
  if !match() return
}</code></pre>
<p>The drawback here is that <code>match</code> will be called twice, and if it is expensive, we just wasted some time.</p>
<p>We could hide it behind some flag:</p>
<pre><code>deepermatch() {
  debug_check
  match()
}</code></pre>
<p>That way we take the performance hit only on debug builds, and still get some protection.</p>
