  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As part of <a href="http://ngzhian.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-google-closure-compiler.html">the series</a> exploring the internals of Google Closure Compiler, this time we are diving into one of the many optimizations that it does, the peephole optimization.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/0f7da6bca71de86ea949fcec45ee8db699a3af45/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/AbstractPeepholeOptimization.java#L22-L28">code itself</a> describes peephole optimizations as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>optimizations that look at a small section of code and either remove
that code (if it is not needed) or replaces it with smaller code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In compiler theory, peephole optimization is a kind of optimization performed over a very small set of instructions in a segment of generated code. The set is called a &gt; "peephole" or a "window". It works by recognising sets of instructions that can be replaced by shorter or faster sets of instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This would be completely correct if it were written as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And it's easy to verify so!</p>
<p>This is a particular kind of peephole optimization that known as "contant folding", which has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">entire wiki page</a> dedicated.</p>
<p>To quote what Wikipedia has to say about constant folding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Constant folding is the process of recognizing and evaluating constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's about getting results event before running any code! I think of it as being similar to static typing, where you can prove correctness without running the code.</p>
<p>The Wiki page gives more examples of constant folding that a compiler may do, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>fold <code>0 * x</code> to <code>0</code></li>
<li>fold <code>"abc" + "def"</code> to <code>"abcdef"</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can find out if the closure compiler does such folding:</p>
<p><code>var z = 0 * 10;</code> gets compiled to <code>var z = 0</code>.</p>
<p>And, probably unsurprisingly, <code>var s = "abc" + "def"</code> gets compiled to <code>var s = "abcdefg"</code>.</p>
<p>A more advanced optimization is <em>Constant Propagation</em>. This is when values of expressions are known during the compilation stage, because they are constant, and can be substituted.</p>
<p>For example, this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>will be compiled down to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">z</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However to get this using the closure compiler, you have to turn on advanced optimizations, the instructions are <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3#enable-app">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you tried this and got and empty file, chances are that the compiler eliminated all code in the <em>dead code elimination</em> pass, where unused code is just thrown away. This is another compilation pass that is enabled when you turn on advanced optimizations.</p>
<p>In this case you can just add a stray log statement to ensure that the variable is used, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and you should see, <code>console.log(20)</code>. Pretty crazy optimizations huh?</p>
<p>Here are the peephole optimizations that the closure compiler has:</p>

<h1>Why would anyone write code like this?</h1>
<p>When I first saw this example, I was thinking to myself, would people even write such code? And almost immediately I realized that I was guilty of this!</p>
<p>When building websites, I often use the <code>setInterval</code> and <code>setTimeout</code> functions. Both of these functions take as their first argument a callback function, and the second argument is a time duration in milliseconds. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">setInterval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hi!&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">},</span> <span class="mi">5000</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Would set off an alert saying 'Hi!' every 5 seconds. It isn't that hard seeing that 5000ms is 5 seconds... Or you could write it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">setInterval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hi!&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">},</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes the 5 extremely obvious.</p>
<p>When more complicated calculations are involved:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">SECONDS_IN_DAY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">24</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">60</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">60</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It's nice knowing that it will be compiled down to <code>SECONDS_IN_DAY=86400</code>.</p>
