<p>Work has been progressing pretty well for our final project, Bubble. I have been working on a <a href='http://ec2-52-77-222-46.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/'>simple demo app</a> that serves as an example for the rest of the team on how to interact with the back-end via Socket.io.</p>
<p>Things are working fairly well on a local development box (of course it would because that’s what I use day to day), but I would like to provide a staging environment on the Internet for my teammates so they don’t have to spin up a local back-end.</p>
<p>That led me into thinking of how best to deploy the back-end, store secrets, separate configuration etc. In this post I’ll talk about secrets and configuration.</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of these ideas are from <a href='https://12factor.net/'>The Twelve-Factor App</a>, an excellent guide on how to build modern web applications.</p>

<h2 id="ConfigurationandSecretsasenvironmentvariables">Configuration and Secrets as environment variables</h2>

<p>This is probably the simplest way to initialize the database (I’m using an ORM for node called <a href='https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize'>sequelize</a>):</p>
<pre class='javascript'><code class='javascript'>const database = new Sequelize(&#39;database&#39;, &#39;user&#39;, &#39;password&#39;);</code></pre>

<p>But this is exposing my database username and password, and is obviously not a good idea.</p>
<p>A better way is to define these secrets somewhere else. A suggested (and popular) method is to put them in the environment.</p>
<pre class='javascript'><code class='javascript'>import &#39;process&#39; from process;
const database = new Sequelize(
  process.env.DATABASE_NAME,
  process.env.DATABASE_USER,
  process.env.DATABASE_PASS);</code></pre>

<p>This is much better, because we are no longer putting our secrets in code.</p>
<p>To run commands with environment variables set, you can:</p>
<pre><code>DATABASE_NAME=database DATABASE_USER=user DATABASE_PASS=pass node index.js</code></pre>

<p>This also means that we can have different database name, user and passwords in development versus production — which is a good idea because if your local credentials get compromised, it doesn’t leak your production credentials.</p>
<h2 id="Toomanyvariables">Too many variables</h2>

<p>This is only for database. In our app we have integrations with <a href='https://www.loggly.com/'>Loggly</a> for logs viewing, and <a href='https://sentry.io/'>Sentry</a> for exception tracking, and your app might have many more. These applications require some sort of secret key, and it’s not a good idea to let anyone else know this because it could lead to them exhausting your free quota or even raking up a huge bill.</p>
<p>All these environment variables can add up really quickly, especially if you are defining them on the command line:</p>
<pre><code>DATABASE_NAME=database DATABASE_USER=user DATABASE_PASS=pass LOGGLY_KEY=loggly_key SENTRY_KEY=sentry_key node index.js</code></pre>

<h2 id="Managingyourenvironmentvariables">Managing your environment variables</h2><p>I ended up doing a bit of research and found <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv'>dotenv</a>.</p>
<p>With dotenv, you can define environment variables in a file, and when your app starts up, you call <code>dotenv.config()</code> and it will add all your variables to the current node.js’ <code>process.env</code> variable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how I used to use it in Bubble:</p>
<pre class='javascript'><code class='javascript'>switch (process.env.NODE_ENV) {
  case &#39;prod&#39;:
    dotenv.config({ path: &#39;./prod.env&#39; });
    break;
  case &#39;development&#39;:
  case &#39;test&#39;:
  default:
    dotenv.config({ path: &#39;./dev.env&#39; });
    break;
}</code></pre>

<p>I define my prod and dev/test environment into two different files, and for <code>dev.env</code> I do not have the secret keys defined (so I don’t accidentally make calls to our third party integrations). I then <code>scp</code> my <code>prod.env</code> file into the box every time there are changes (primitive, but the secrets don’t change often, so everything is cool).</p>
<h2 id="Smallproblem">Small problem</h2>

<p>The above code was defined in a <code>database.js</code> file, which is used to initialize the database. However I wanted to extend this dotenv pattern across my app. So what I really needed is to call <code>dotenv.config()</code> as early as I can in my app initialization. But there’s some issue with the way babel transpiles ES6 module imports that is described <a href='https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/133#issue-145471155'>here</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, babel lifts ES6 imports to the top, so when code is run, node does a depth-first traversal into the imported modules (which may use dotenv), before dotenv gets a chance to run, so <code>process.env</code> isn’t populated. I eventually figured a workaround and posted my solution as a <a href='https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/133#issuecomment-255298822'>comment to the same issue</a>. The solution is pretty simple, move the <code>dotenv.config()</code> call into a <a href='https://github.com/CS3216-Bubble/bubble/blob/master/src/env.js'>separate file</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/CS3216-Bubble/bubble/blob/master/src/index.js'>import it before any modules</a> that needs <code>process.env</code> to be set.</p>
<h2 id="Populatingyourenvironment">Populating your environment</h2>

<p>This is post is about how I use environment variables and dotenv to help manage them. This definitely isn’t the correct way or the only way, there has been ink spilled over this. One article I like is <a href='http://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/twelve-factor-config-misunderstandings-and-advice/'>Twelve-Factor Config: Misunderstandings and Advice</a>, which discusses more about Twelve-Factor and its recommendation on configuration, and how you can populate your app environment in whatever way pleases you.</p>
